# grib downloader for arome model

this should allow you to:

- download arome grib
- convert to image or json

this may allow you to download grib from others sources if the system is similar

This is very much a work in progress composed of messy and buggy code.
however I will not (or almost not) touch it till at least february.

If you find some use of it... Enjoy!
